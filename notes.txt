- Constructor subpopulation must take reference to an environment
- Class subpopulation must have method to set the environment. Update: Such a method is not necessary, because the environment id EI is a public variable of class subpopulation
- All methods that call the subpopulation constructor must pass the id of an environment to the constructor. Affected methods: population::add_subpopulatio(), population::execute_event(), initialize_from_file()
- A subpopulation can only be constructed and assigned an environment if the respective environment has already been defined. This must be ensured by the programmer.

- Started change from passing a reference to the map of environments to W() and update_fitness(), to passing only the reference to the correct single environment. TODO: Go on with this; add const where environment references are passed, because environments must not be changed. [DONE]

==========

- Finished pending TODO from 11/17/2014
- Started working on output of subpopulation-specific prevalences. First, adjust polymorphism.print(), then polymorphism.print_noi(). Then work on population.print_all() [two], population.print_sample() [2], population.print_sample_ms(), population.add_mut(), population.track_mutations()
- changed polymorphism.print() and ditto.print_noi(). Before proceeding with further methods mentioned above, finish working through population.track_mutations(), starting from l. 1853
