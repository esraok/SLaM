==========

- Constructor subpopulation must take reference to an environment
- Class subpopulation must have method to set the environment. Update: Such a method is not necessary, because the environment id EI is a public variable of class subpopulation
- All methods that call the subpopulation constructor must pass the id of an environment to the constructor. Affected methods: population::add_subpopulatio(), population::execute_event(), initialize_from_file()
- A subpopulation can only be constructed and assigned an environment if the respective environment has already been defined. This must be ensured by the programmer.

- Started change from passing a reference to the map of environments to subpopulation::W() and subpopulation::update_fitness(), to passing only the reference to the correct single environment. TODO: Go on with this; add const where environment references are passed, because environments must not be changed. [DONE]

==========

- Started working on output of subpopulation-specific prevalences. First, adjust polymorphism::print() [DONE], then polymorphism::print_noi() [DONE]. Then work on population::print_all() [two versions, DONE], population::print_sample() [DONE], population::print_sample_ms() [DONE], population::add_mut() [DONE], population::track_mutations()[DONE], population::find_mut() [called by population::print_all() and population::pring_sample(), DONE]
- REMARK: The method polymorphism::print_noi() is used to print subpopulation-specific prevalences, yet in its current implementation, it gives dominance and selection coefficients valid for the reference environment, not for the respective subpopulation. This could be changed later, if needed.
- Adjusting population::track_mutations() to account for changes in class polymorphism [DONE]
- Improved formatting of population::remove_fixed(), polymorphic(), and fixed() [DONE]. REMARK: I have not fully checked these methods, but merely focussed on improving the formatting (indentation)
- Proceed on l. 2105
